# 📱 Flutter Connected Cars System

## 👋 Overview of idea for mobiles

Almost 48,400 cars in 2021 were recorded by police as stolen(Rob 2022). As the rising rates of car crime in the UK, car security is now more important than ever before. This mobile application is built to **protect your cars from stealing** by monitoring the alerts and take actions as events.🚘

This project is based on Flutter, and I try to apply the knowledge of deep learning and IoT to achieve my goal. How to monitor the car condition and environment and analysis the environment data are challenges. 


## 📸 Preview
I will edit this part in the future.



## 🔎 Procesws
To make it useful and user-friendly, I follow this framework in the mobile app design process.

### 🚩Empathise(Probllem to solve)

#### Background analysis
Almost 48,400 cars in 2021 were recorded by police as stolen(Rob 2022). As the rising rates of car crime in the UK, car security is now more important than ever before. This mobile application is built to **protect your cars from stealing** by monitoring the alerts and take actions as events.🚘

#### Persona

I interviewed four car owner in UK, and make the persona to analysis potensial users' painpoint and requirement.

#### Competitor analysis

Actually, almost every wehicle band has their own wehicles management appication. So I analysis their functions and design to build a competitive mobile product.

### 🚩Ideate

#### Problem to solve
According to above analysis, I thought this mobile system need to solve these problems:
- 🤏Rising rates of car crime(especially, stealing) in UK
- 😨Worry about the car condition(Whether to close the door and window)
- 😱Cannot take action when events occurs

#### Identification of the functionality of the mobile app
- 📊Cars list(allow you to monitor several cars)
- 📈Sensor data visualisation(easy to understand your cars’ status)
- 🚨Alarm Function(alerts you in the events)
- 🎮Actuation Function(control your cars remotely)

### 🌊Ideate

#### User flow
I design the user flow to simulate every step the user takes - from the entry point right through to the final interaction. This task flow focus on how users travel through the platform while performing a specific task

#### Wireframe
The user flow in parper is helpful before building the detailed project.

### 📱 Prototype

#### Low-fidelity prototype
I use Figma to design the low-fi prototype. And three interviewers is invited to test it. They gave some useful suggestions.

#### Hi-fidelity prototype
After modifying the first edition prototype and interview with users, I design a Hi-fi prototype with interaction. The hi-fi prototypes cover not only the user interface (UI) of the product in terms of visuals and aesthetics, but also the user experience (UX) aspects in terms of interactions, user flow and behaviour.

- UI design styleboard

- Interaction design

### Test
There are a total of three rounds of user testing throughout the whole process. The first was when the wireframe was finished, and I got feedback from professors and peers. The second was the low-fidelity model, where three potential users helped with a simple test. They were asked to complete certain tasks (such as finding the location of the car, checking the status of the lights). After taking their advice, I proceeded with the design of the high-fidelity model, and again, after the high-fidelity model was completed, three users were invited to participate in the test.


### Implement

#### Data collection
The API, interior and physical sensor are used to collect data and enhance the application.
