# 📱 Flutter Connected Cars System

## 👋 Overview of idea for mobiles

As the rising rates of car crime in the UK, car security is now more important than ever before. This mobile application is built to protect your cars from stealing by monitoring the alerts and take actions as events.🚘

This project is based on Flutter, and I try to apply the knowledge of deep learning and IoT to achieve my goal. How to monitor the car condition and environment and analysis the environment data are challenges. Besides, to make it useful and user-friendly, I follow this framework in the mobile app design process.
